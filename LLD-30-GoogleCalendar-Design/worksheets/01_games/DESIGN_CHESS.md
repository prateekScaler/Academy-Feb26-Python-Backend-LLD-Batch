## Overview

A two-player game on an 8×8 board; each piece type moves differently and the goal is to checkmate the opponent's king.

> **Difficulty:** Hard &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Key concepts:** Piece inheritance, move validation, check/checkmate

## Expectations

* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable — clean, professional-level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable — accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
* Code should follow good OOP design principles (SOLID, and the right design patterns).

## Requirements gathering

What questions would you ask to clarify scope before designing? Write yours first.

```


```

## Requirements

List ~8–10 functional requirements. Don't worry about getting them "right" — the skill is anticipating what the system needs. Write yours, then reveal the sample.

```

  1. Two players, one assigned white and one black; white moves first.
  2. All standard chess rules are enforced; only legal moves are allowed.
  3. Six piece types, each with its own movement rule.
  4. Players alternate turns; moves cannot be undone.
  5. The system keeps a log of all moves.
  6. The game ends on checkmate, stalemate, resignation, or forfeit.
  7. Detect check and prevent moves that leave one's own king in check.
  8. Support capturing opponent pieces.

## Use case diagrams

### Actors

Who are the actors (the roles that interact with the system)?

```


```

### Use cases

For each actor, list their interactions with the system.

#### Actor 1

Name of the actor — ` `

```
1. 
2. 
3. 
```

#### Actor 2

Name of the actor — ` `

```
1. 
2. 
3. 
```

*(Add more actors as needed.)*

**Draw the use-case diagram.**

```


```

## Class diagram

What are the major classes and their attributes?

```
Class name
  - attribute 1
  - attribute 2
```

List the cardinalities of the relationships between classes.

```


```

**Draw the class diagram** (mark composition ◆ / aggregation ◇, and the multiplicities).

```


```

## API design

Design an API for each use case. Format:

`name` — `HTTP METHOD` — `/url` — `?request body` — `?response body`

```


```
