## Overview

Users search flights between cities/dates, choose seats in a cabin class, add passengers, pay, and receive a PNR.

> **Difficulty:** Hard &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Key concepts:** Seat classes, passengers, PNR

## Expectations

* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable — clean, professional-level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable — accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
* Code should follow good OOP design principles (SOLID, and the right design patterns).

## Requirements gathering

What questions would you ask to clarify scope before designing? Write yours first.

```


```

## Requirements

List ~8–10 functional requirements. Don't worry about getting them "right" — the skill is anticipating what the system needs. Write yours, then reveal the sample.

```


```

  1. Search flights by origin, destination, and date.
  2. A flight has cabin classes (economy/business) each with seats and fares.
  3. A booking can include multiple passengers.
  4. Select seats per passenger; held during payment.
  5. Generate a PNR on successful payment.
  6. Prevent double-booking of a seat.
  7. Support cancellation/refund and seat changes.
  8. Show fare breakdown (base + taxes).

## Use case diagrams

### Actors

Who are the actors (the roles that interact with the system)?

```


```

### Use cases

For each actor, list their interactions with the system.

#### Actor 1

Name of the actor — ` `

```
1. 
2. 
3. 
```

#### Actor 2

Name of the actor — ` `

```
1. 
2. 
3. 
```

*(Add more actors as needed.)*

**Draw the use-case diagram.**

```


```

## Class diagram

What are the major classes and their attributes?

```
Class name
  - attribute 1
  - attribute 2
```

List the cardinalities of the relationships between classes.

```


```

**Draw the class diagram** (mark composition ◆ / aggregation ◇, and the multiplicities).

```


```

## API design

Design an API for each use case. Format:

`name` — `HTTP METHOD` — `/url` — `?request body` — `?response body`

```


```
