## Overview

Users browse movies and shows, pick seats in a hall, and pay; two users must never book the same seat.

> **Difficulty:** Medium &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Key concepts:** Seat locking, show management, concurrency

## Expectations

* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable — clean, professional-level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable — accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
* Code should follow good OOP design principles (SOLID, and the right design patterns).

## Requirements gathering

What questions would you ask to clarify scope before designing? Write yours first.

```


```

## Requirements

List ~8–10 functional requirements. Don't worry about getting them "right" — the skill is anticipating what the system needs. Write yours, then reveal the sample.

```


```

  <summary><strong>Click to see sample requirements</strong></summary>

  1. Browse movies by city/theatre and see their shows.
  2. A show is a movie on a screen at a time; a screen has seats.
  3. A user selects one or more available seats for a show.
  4. A seat is held while the user pays (a soft lock with a timeout).
  5. Two users cannot book the same seat (no double-booking).
  6. On payment success, a ticket is issued; on timeout, the hold is released.
  7. Support seat types/pricing (e.g., normal/premium).
  8. Allow cancellation within a cut-off.

## Use case diagrams

### Actors

Who are the actors (the roles that interact with the system)?

```


```

### Use cases

For each actor, list their interactions with the system.

#### Actor 1

Name of the actor — ` `

```
1. 
2. 
3. 
```

#### Actor 2

Name of the actor — ` `

```
1. 
2. 
3. 
```

*(Add more actors as needed.)*

**Draw the use-case diagram.**

```


```

## Class diagram

What are the major classes and their attributes?

```
Class name
  - attribute 1
  - attribute 2
```

List the cardinalities of the relationships between classes.

```


```

**Draw the class diagram** (mark composition ◆ / aggregation ◇, and the multiplicities).

```


```

## API design

Design an API for each use case. Format:

`name` — `HTTP METHOD` — `/url` — `?request body` — `?response body`

```


```
